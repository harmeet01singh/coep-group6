image,text,030203,v1,Find total distance between school and hospital ?,$200$,,,,$196$,$208$,$50$,60,3,Positive_Distance_Value_1.png,2019surendra.totre@ves.ac.in,"
--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and hospital = distance between school and metro + distance between metro and hospital
=> distance between school and hospital = $75 + 125$
=> distance between school and hospital = $200$
Hence the correct answer is $200$.",
