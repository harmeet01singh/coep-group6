--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and school = distance between park and school - distance between park and house 
=> distance between house and school = $218 - 123$
=> distance between house and school = $95$
Hence the correct answer is $95$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and metro = distance between park and metro - distance between park and school 
=> distance between school and metro = $257 - 77$
=> distance between school and metro = $180$
Hence the correct answer is $180$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between hospital and park = distance between metro and park - distance between metro and hospital 
=> distance between hospital and park = $287 - 66$
=> distance between hospital and park = $221$
Hence the correct answer is $221$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and house = distance between park and house - distance between park and school 
=> distance between school and house = $236 - 105$
=> distance between school and house = $131$
Hence the correct answer is $131$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between park and house = distance between metro and house - distance between metro and park 
=> distance between park and house = $285 - 120$
=> distance between park and house = $165$
Hence the correct answer is $165$.",
