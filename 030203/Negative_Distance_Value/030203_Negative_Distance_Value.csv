--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between metro and school = distance between house and school - distance between house and metro 
=> distance between metro and school = $273 - 140$
=> distance between metro and school = $133$
Hence the correct answer is $133$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and metro = distance between park and metro - distance between park and school 
=> distance between school and metro = $229 - 63$
=> distance between school and metro = $166$
Hence the correct answer is $166$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and house = distance between park and house - distance between park and school 
=> distance between school and house = $237 - 117$
=> distance between school and house = $120$
Hence the correct answer is $120$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and metro = distance between school and metro - distance between school and house 
=> distance between house and metro = $208 - 104$
=> distance between house and metro = $104$
Hence the correct answer is $104$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between metro and school = distance between house and school - distance between house and metro 
=> distance between metro and school = $289 - 65$
=> distance between metro and school = $224$
Hence the correct answer is $224$.",
