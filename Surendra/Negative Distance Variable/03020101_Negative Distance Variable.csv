text,1,03020101,1,"If total distance between park and school is x, then what is the distance between metro and school in terms of x ?",$x - 143$,,,,$143 + x$,$-(x + 143)$,$143 - x$,60,3,,,"
--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between metro and school = distance between park and school - distance between park and metro
=> distance between metro and school = $x - 143$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 143$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and house = distance between hospital and house - distance between hospital and school
=> distance between school and house = $x - 140$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 140$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and metro = distance between hospital and metro - distance between hospital and house
=> distance between house and metro = $x - 132$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 132$.",
text,1,03020101,1,"If total distance between metro and park is x, then what is the distance between house and park in terms of x ?",$x - 56$,,,,$56 + x$,$56 - x$,$-(x + 56)$,60,3,,,"
--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and park = distance between metro and park - distance between metro and house
=> distance between house and park = $x - 56$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 56$.",
text,1,03020101,1,"If total distance between park and house is x, then what is the distance between metro and house in terms of x ?",$x - 78$,,,,$-(x + 78)$,$78 - x$,$78 + x$,60,3,,,"
--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between metro and house = distance between park and house - distance between park and metro
=> distance between metro and house = $x - 78$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 78$.",
