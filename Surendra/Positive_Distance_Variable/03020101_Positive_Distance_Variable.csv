image,text,03020101,v1,Find total distance between house and hospital in terms of x ?,$110 + x$,,,,$110 - x$,$x - 110$,$-(x + 110)$,60,3,Positive_Distance_Variable_1.png,2019surendra.totre@ves.ac.in,"
--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and hospital = distance between house and school + distance between school and hospital 
=> distance between house and hospital = $110 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $110 + x$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and school = distance between house and metro + distance between metro and school 
=> distance between house and school = $102 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $102 + x$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between hospital and park = distance between hospital and metro + distance between metro and park 
=> distance between hospital and park = $67 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $67 + x$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between hospital and metro = distance between hospital and park + distance between park and metro 
=> distance between hospital and metro = $132 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $132 + x$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between hospital and park = distance between hospital and house + distance between house and park 
=> distance between hospital and park = $52 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $52 + x$.",
