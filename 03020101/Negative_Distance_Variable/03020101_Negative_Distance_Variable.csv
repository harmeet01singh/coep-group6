--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and metro = distance between house and metro - distance between house and school
=> distance between school and metro = $x - 139$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 139$.",

=> distance between school and park = distance between metro and park - distance between metro and school
=> distance between school and park = $x - 52$

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and school = distance between park and school - distance between park and house
=> distance between house and school = $x - 104$

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between park and school = distance between metro and school - distance between metro and park
=> distance between park and school = $x - 63$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 63$.",
