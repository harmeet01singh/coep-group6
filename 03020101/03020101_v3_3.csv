--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between house and metro = distance between park and metro - distance between park and house
=> distance between house and metro = $x - 73$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 73$.",

=> distance between park and metro = distance between house and metro - distance between house and park
=> distance between park and metro = $x - 99$

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between park and school = distance between hospital and school - distance between hospital and park
=> distance between park and school = $x - 72$ 
Hence the correct answer is $x - 72$.",
