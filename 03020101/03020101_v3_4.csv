image,text,03020101,v3,Find total distance between school and house in terms of x ?,$138 + x$,,,,$x - 138$,$138 - x$,$-(x + 138)$,60,3,03020101_PDX_138+x.png,2019surendra.totre@ves.ac.in,"
--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and house = distance between school and metro + distance between metro and house 
=> distance between school and house = $138 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $138 + x$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between metro and park = distance between metro and hospital + distance between hospital and park 
=> distance between metro and park = $88 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $88 + x$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between school and hospital = distance between school and park + distance between park and hospital 
=> distance between school and hospital = $136 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $136 + x$.",

--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
=> distance between metro and school = distance between metro and hospital + distance between hospital and school 
=> distance between metro and school = $113 + x$ 
Hence the correct answer is $113 + x$.",
