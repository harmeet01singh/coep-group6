text,text,30301,v1,Q)Simplify the following expression by applying the BODMAS rule : $50$\div$4$\times$5-40$,$[(50$\div$4)$\times$5]-40$,,,,$[(50-4)$\times$(5$\div$40)]$,$[50$\div$(4$\times$5)-40]$,$[(50$\div$4)$\times$(5-40)]$,60,3,,2019mangesh.sokalwar@ves.ac.in,"
--------------------------------------SOLUTION-------------------------------------------
As per the BODMAS rule:
Rule 1- DM: if more than one operation is to be carried out, then multiplication and division are carried out first,
            in the order in which they occur from left to right,hence the expression becomes $[(50$\div$4)$\times$5]$
Rule 2- AS: After that, addition and subtraction are carried out.
            in the order in which they occur from left to right,hence the expression becomes $[(50$\div$4)$\times$5]-40$
Therefore option $2$ is right selection ",
